# 🌿 Smart HVAC Energy Optimization System
An AI-based IoT system that reduces energy waste in classrooms by automatically controlling HVAC systems based on occupancy and environmental conditions.
## 📌 Problem
In many institutions, ACs and heaters stay ON even when rooms are empty. This leads to:
- High electricity costs (₹15–20 lakhs yearly waste)
- Increased carbon emissions
- Dependence on manual control
## 🚀 Solution
Our system uses sensors and machine learning to automatically manage HVAC systems. It monitors room occupancy, temperature, humidity, and weather data, then decides when to switch devices ON or OFF.
- Occupancy detection using PIR sensors
- Weather-aware adjustments
- Automated relay-based device control
- Real-time dashboard for monitoring
- ML-based usage prediction
## 🏗 Tech Stack
- Hardware: ESP32, PIR sensor, DHT22, Relay module
- Software: React.js, Node.js, Express.js
- ML: YOLOv8n
## 📊 Expected Impact
- 30–40% energy savings
- ₹8–10 lakhs annual cost reduction
- Lower carbon footprint
## Future Add-ons
- Multi-room deployment
- Mobile app integration
- Advanced predictive models
